The automated grader system apparently does not work with Rust.

I had to compile a statically-linked Rust binary and use a Python wrapper to invoke the program.

To compile the Rust binary:

RUSTFLAGS='-C linker=ld.lld -C relocation-model=static -C strip=symbols' cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

VMTranslator.py is the wrapper.
